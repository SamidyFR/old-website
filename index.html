     <h1> extras: </h1>
     <p> added the website to github, its a template now. i just really hate how most "easy website builders" throw ads into your website and dont even allow you to download your website. well now make your own website without even needing to know basic html knowledge. and yes its really simple, but its good for a little portfolio. you can use neocities as the text editor or really </p> whatever you want lmao, just please read the README.md included in the download (idek if this helps if you don't know html, I just threw it into GitHub as a joke at first)
