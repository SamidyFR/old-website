  <h1> BLOG 1: Website is now released! </h1>
  <p> Welp, im finally done with the website. ill keep this really short for now but yeah, HTML is such a fun language to code in (at least with the simple stuff yknow). i didnt bother with the CSS as i didnt really have any ideas on how i wanted this website to look, but all and all it looks good for my first website. have a good day!
