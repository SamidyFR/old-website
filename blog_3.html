    <h1>BLOG 3: operating systems in general</h1>

    <p>Welp, finally felt like writing another one of these. felt like talking about operating systems (mainly Linux) so.... anyone here tried Linux? eh whatever. I love Linux, only reason I'm using windows on my main pc is due to gaming (no, I'm not gonna use proton ffs). if you have an old computer that runs BADLY on windows give Linux a try. this is coming from a guy who used to actually like Microsoft </p>

    <p> speaking of windows... its just a shitty mess now. it's been said a million times but, it's true. most people I know are only sticking to windows for gaming and the terminal </p>
    <hr>
    <p> Mac OS is... it's alright. I love it's UI but there's no customization at ALL. + it's pretty locked down on what you can do </p>

    <p> that's all I really wanted to say. I write these whenever I want to </p>
