    <h1>BLOG 2: Games, Bundles And MONEY</h1>
    <p> have yall heard about the black ops 6 leak? they literally got everything lmao. you can even play online on jailbroken ps4s which is CRAZY to me. cod is ass now. the game peaked at black ops 3 (which arguably had the best zombies and multiplayer oat. next to bo2) but the campaign was ass so ill give it that. the only games i can think of that came out after bo3 that were good were cold war amd MW 19. </p>

    <p> ok, lets talk about other games. i recently bought the capcom bundle from humble bundle, great value bundle! i got the 9 item pack, only for 20$. i already owned dead rising 2 and dragons dogma dark arisen was for some reason banned in my country so i just gave those to my friends. you should totally give humble bundle a try, very great value bundles. also game burnout, yeah. i hate it. i mean everybody hates burnout but like... idk man. </p>
